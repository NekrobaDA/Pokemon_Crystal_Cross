Smeargle, Aerodactyl, Sudowoodo, Dragonair, Rapidash, Lickitung, Eevee

Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres are roaming encounters in Kanto
Roamers should no longer jump routes when using fly

Mewtwo added as a static encounter in a cave in Cerulean
Mew is encounterable via a secret method

Celebi event has been re-enabled

HM moves can be forgotten at any time
A Move Relearner has also been added in Blackthorn 

Enabled the Shiny Ditto mimic glitch from gen 1 to work
Edited shiny DV ranges to allow for shiny female starters and other 12.5% female species
(shinies should be slightly more common in general)

Coin Case has been rebroken (though I doubt any existing ACE codes will work with this rom)

Wild pokemon scale with your badges (speficically Fog badge and Rising badge)
Evening added as a 4th time of day

Individual party menu icons and colors for each normal and shiny pokemon

Bugs;
Pikachu has its male and female gender dimorphism, however the backsprite does not display correctly

Currently some weekly pokemon are appearing on days other than their specified day; cause is currently unknown.
